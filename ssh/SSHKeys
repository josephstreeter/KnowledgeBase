# SSH Keys
SSH Keys are asymetric cryprographic keys, or key pairs, that are used for authorization and authentication. 
A key pair consists of a private key (Identification key) and a public key (Authorization key). The owner of a key pair is authorized access to a resource by installing that user's public key (Authorization) on that resource. 
The user then uses the private key (Identity) to authenticate to that resource. The private key is protected by a passowrd or passphrase that only the owner knows. A users private key's are to be protected the same as passwords.

SSH keys may be used to interactivly access a host or service or can be used to privide authorization and authentication to automated processes.
This is typically accomplised by creating a key pair without a password. 

# Host Keys
Host keys represent a server's identity and are used by the client to authenticate that server's identity.
The first time a client accesses a server, the client will prompt the user, displaying a hash of the server's host key and asking the user to expliicitly accept it. 
```
$ ssh -t git@ssh.github.com
The authenticity of host 'ssh.github.com (140.82.114.36)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

If the host key stored in 'known_hosts' does not match the one presented to the client by the server the client will promp the usuer, asking if the user wants to continue.
```
$ ssh -t git@ssh.github.com
The authenticity of host 'ssh.github.com (140.82.114.36)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.
This host key is known by the following other names/addresses:
    ~/.ssh/known_hosts:11: [hashed name]
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? no
Host key verification failed.
